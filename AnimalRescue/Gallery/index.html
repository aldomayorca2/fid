<p>Welcome to our gallery! This is where we keep an update on what dogs, cats, and other animals are ready to be adopted and looking for a forever home! Some are in pictures together because they are inseparable and even though it is perfectly fine to adopt them separately, it would be much preffered if the inseperable ones are adopted together. All pets have been fully vaccinated and neutured.</p>

<h2>Chuckles</h2>


  <img src="Dog1.jpg" alt="Chuckles" >
<p>
<br>Meet Chuckles! This good boy is only 3 years old and is ready to find his forever home. He is a very playful and loyal dog. He can be a bit clumsy as he is missing one eye, but I promise he will give you a good laugh and you'll never have a dull day. He is great with other animals and with children. He gets a bit nervous around vacuums and things with wheels, but other than that he is a very happy dog. </p>



<h2>Oreo and Ursula</h2>

<br>
<p>Meet Oreo and Ursula (names read from left to right). These cats were found and rescued together and never leave each others side. They are very calm and sweet angels that are looking for their forever home. They love to sleep and will sleep in many funny positions. Sometimes we get scared thinking one is suffocating the other, but they seem very content the way they sleep, so don't be alarmed if one is on top of the other like that. They are both young, around 2 years old.</p>

<h2>Loaf</h2>

<br>
<p>Meet our special Loaf! She looks like a loaf of bread and likes to become flat like a pancake! Loaf can get startled easily, but she LOVES to eat. Once you feed her, she will keep coming back for more. </p>

<h2>Mocha, Caramel, and Peanut</h2>

  <img src="cat2.WEBP" alt="The three Muskateers">
<br>
<p>From left to right, these kittens are Mocha, Caramel, and Peanut. The three are from the same litter and can be very fesity when they get hungry. They love to play with toys and are very very vocal when they want something, so be prepared to have a kitten talk back to you. They are all a few months old and ready to find their loving home.</p>


<h2>Lucas and Mollie</h2>

  <img src="dog2.jpg" alt="Father-Daughter Duo">
<br>
<p>Meet Lucas and Mollie! Lucas, the bigger dog is the actual father of the smaller dog, Mollie. They were both found and rescued together and care deeply for each other. Unfortunately, we were unable to find the mother, but these two have stuck together through thick and thin and are ready to have their forever home to enjoy the rest of their lives.</p>
