<h2>The Organization</h2>
<p>The Pawerful Rescue is an organization that began about 40 years ago. It is now a rescue for just about every animal that most people have as pets. The organization provides vet care for each animal rescued, whether they are only slightly injured or severely injured. Funds for this is usually made from donations or adoptions. </p>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>This organization originally began as a mean for rescuing dogs, however, we started to recieve phone calls from around the world for just about any animal. Eventually, we began to take on rescues from dogs, cats, bunnies, and even birds! Now we work with other organizations that can rescue up to exotic animals and tend for them. </p>
