<h2>What happens if you run out of room?</h2>
<p>Thankfully, we have a lot of avaialable space for all types of rescued animals due to our growth in the last few years. However, if we do end up running out of room it is not a problem because we are able to stay connected to other rescue centers that we currently work with, increasing adoption rates for all shelters. We began to work with many shelters that specialize in exotic animals as well, that way we are prepared for as many things as possible. </p>

<h2>How far are you willing to travel to rescue animals?</h2>
<p>First off, we strongly advise you to reach out to other organizations that are near your area. We advise this so that animals can get rescued almost immediately. If rescues are unsuccessful, feel free to contact us and we will then try to help in any way in can. In extreme cases, we will find a way to fly out and help. </p>

<h2>Do you rescue exotic animals?</h2>
<p>We are not very knowledgable in exotic animals but if we can, we try to help as much as possible. We work with places that focus on exotic animals, so if can rescue them, we then transfer the animals to their care.
</p>

<h2>Do you just take animals that you find and have them out for adoption?</h2>
<p>No. The first thing we do is search if they have an owner. If they are not owned by anyone, then we take care of all their needs whether medical or other, and put them out for adoption once they are ready to find their forever loving home.
