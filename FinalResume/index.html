    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> "I'm a Peruvian-born student at Seminole State College with an interest in art and fantasy. I'm a fan of music, games, and stories all around, with Kirby being my favorite game series, and JoJo's bizarre Adventure being my favorite manga [Japanese comic]. My music collection is ever-expanding. I am majoring in computer science and hope to design my own video game using inspiration from my favorite hobbies."</p>

<p>"I mainly create art and come up with ideas for games without revealing them, but I hope to someday be able to have them come to life. I am currently working on a small project with a family member who is in the same field."</p>
